# ⏳ Time Tracker Web

This is the **frontend** for the **Time Tracker App**, a productivity platform that lets users set hour-based learning goals (e.g. “Learn German A1 – 100 hours”) and track time spent toward those goals.

Built with **Next.js**, **TypeScript**, and **Tailwind CSS**, the app offers a clean UI for managing skills, logging time, and visualizing progress.
